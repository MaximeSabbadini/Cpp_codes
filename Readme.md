## Student_text

This code enables to store the info of a student with his average mark (mean)
in a .txt file.

All the informations on the .txt file have to follow the same criterias
as follow :

Surname Name DateOfBirth(format dd/mm/yyyy) AverageMark

Note that the search is sensitive to capital letters.


## Class_Point

Usage of Object-Oriented programming by the definition of Point class which
represents a point in 2-Dimensional plane.


## Public_Inheritence

Usage of inheritence with the Point class by defining classes that inherit
from each other (see UML diagram for details)


## Vectors

Usage of vectors with classes. We defined a vector named Garage and that stores
vehicles. We save the garage into a txt file to be loaded later.
The text file is organised as follow :
TypeOfVehicle Price NumberOfDoors

TypeOfVehicle is either 1 for car or 2 for motorcycle.
